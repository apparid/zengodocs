SSO ID: A Complete Guide to Single Sign-On in India
===================================================

Introduction to SSO ID Login, Registration
------------
Managing multiple usernames and passwords can be frustrating. **SSO ID** 
(Single Sign-On Identification) solves this problem by allowing users 
to log in once and access multiple online services seamlessly. 
In India, `SSO ID <https://gbapps.blog/sso-id/>`_ is especially popular in government portals like 
the Rajasthan SSO platform, where citizens can use a single login 
for dozens of state services.

What is SSO ID?
---------------
**Full Form:** Single Sign-On Identification (SSO)

An SSO ID is a unique digital identity that provides access to multiple 
applications using one set of login credentials. Once logged in, 
you can switch between connected services without logging in again.

How SSO Works
-------------
1. User logs in through an SSO-enabled portal.
2. The system verifies credentials via a central authentication server.
3. Once authenticated, the session grants access to multiple linked applications.
4. Logging out from one service can log you out from all connected services.
